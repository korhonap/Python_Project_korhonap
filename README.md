# Python_Project_korhonap
Python Project- Scripting Languages

For this project, my goal was to create a script that cleaned up messy filenames. My script will look within a directory and evaluate the names of the files. If any files contain a space or special character that is not allowed, it will either replace the space with a "_", or it will remove the special characters. Once it finds which filenames do not match the proper format, it will rename the file and create a csv log of the changes. During writing this script, I found a really cool dry run argument which still created the csv file and showed the output, but did not actually change the file names. This allowed me to test my poorly named files without having to rename them again after the script properly named them.
